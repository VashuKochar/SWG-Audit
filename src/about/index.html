        <h3>Problem: perimeter validation gap</h3>
        <p>Attackers have outpaced traditional security tools. URL categorisation and reputation databases cannot keep up with newly registered domains and evasion techniques. Organisations rely on vendor claims and product specifications without independent verification. The gap increases risk when budgets are committed. Compliance with national or industry expectations for perimeter validation requires evidence, not assertions.</p>

        <h3 id="benefit-heading">Benefit: independent assessment before investment</h3>
        <p>Assessment before investment reduces procurement risk and supports auditability. Security teams validate that a Secure Web Gateway or similar control blocks the threats it claims to block—in real‑time, under actual network conditions. SWG Audit is an open‑source initiative that provides safe, repeatable simulations aligned with how modern attacks evade legacy defences.</p>

        <h3 id="advantage-heading">Advantage: safe, reviewable, no lock‑in</h3>
        <p>Simulations use standard test artefacts (e.g. EICAR). Submitted data is discarded immediately. No real attacks are launched. The project is open‑source; architecture and data flows can be reviewed. No vendor lock‑in and no dependency on proprietary test environments.</p>
