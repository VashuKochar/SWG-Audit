## Content Structure (PBAC)

Follow **Problem → Benefit → Advantage → Call‑to‑Action** in a single, clear flow. Focus heavily on the problem; use narrative to tell the story of problem and solution in a natural, deducing flow. Cover all cases to avoid ambiguity.

### 1. Problem Statement
- **Security Challenge:** Briefly describe the security or operational challenge the feature addresses
- **Real‑World Scenarios:** Illustrate why and when a client would need this feature
- **Business Context:** Connect technical problems to business impact

### 2. Key Benefits
- **Desired Outcome:** Highlight primary advantages and security outcomes of enabling the feature
- **Value Proposition:** Quantify benefits where possible (performance, security enhancements)
- **Competitive Advantage:** Position against competitor solutions

### 3. Prerequisites (for simulations and feature docs)
- **Client‑Side Preparations:** Tasks the client must complete independently (e.g. firewall setup, certificate generation)
- **SafeSquid‑Side Setup:** Required configurations within SafeSquid before enabling the feature
- **System Requirements:** Hardware, software, and network prerequisites

### 4. Call to Action
- **Step‑by‑Step Actions:** Detailed implementation procedures
- **Verification & Validation:** Confirm successful implementation and correct functioning at every step
- **Congruence Check:** Ensure the solution addresses the problem statement

### 5. Solution Verification
- **Interface Checks:** Verify configuration in SafeSquid interface
- **Log Analysis:** Review logs for proper functioning
- **Performance Validation:** Confirm solution performs correctly or identify needed tweaks

### 6. Troubleshooting Guide
- **Common Issues & Scenarios:** List potential errors or misconfigurations
- **Resolution Steps:** Clear solutions mapped to each issue
- **Escalation Procedures:** When to contact support

## Voice and Tone

- **Professional:** Maintain enterprise‑grade technical documentation standards
- **Clear and Direct:** Use precise, unambiguous language; active voice only
- **Consistent:** Follow established terminology and naming conventions
- **Accessible:** Write for users with varying technical expertise; keep simple enough for a layman but never dumb it down
- **Neutral:** No glorifying words, no adverbs; no aggressive or hype‑driven “Silicon Valley” messaging
- **Technical Level:** High — strategic, with attention to data flows and compliance logging. Reference regulations and compliance frameworks. Educate through technical clarity and clear assertions.

---

## Writing Style

- **Minimum words:** Remove anything not adding value
- **No pronouns:** Use proper nouns only
- **Active voice only** (e.g. “Create a new policy” not “A new policy should be created”)
- **Present tense for procedures** (e.g. “Click the Button” not “You should click”)
- **Short sentences:** ≤ 20 words; short, declarative sentences; high signal density
- **Narrative style:** Tell the story in a natural deducing flow
- **Cover all cases:** Avoid ambiguity
- **Technically precise:** Correct terminology; avoid jargon unless defined; explain technical terms on first use
- **No unnecessary jargon**
- **Memorable phrases** where they add clarity
- **Headings = bottom line:** State the key point directly
- **Hyphens:** Use non‑breaking hyphens (Unicode U+2011, ‑) in user‑facing content for compound terms (e.g. Zero‑Trust, real‑time, content‑aware). Do not change hyphens in code identifiers, URLs, or class names.
- **Orphans:** Avoid single words on the last line of a paragraph. Use `text-balance` on headings and `prose-avoid-orphans` (or CSS `orphans: 2; widows: 2`) on body text
- **Layout:** Prefer golden‑ratio proportions (φ ≈ 1.618) for two‑column splits: `1.618fr 1fr` for content‑primary + supporting; for three columns use `1fr 1.618fr 1fr` with the centre as focus

---

## Document Structure

- **Frontmatter:** Start each document with title, description, keywords (and SEO metatags where applicable)
- **Headings:** Clear hierarchy — H1 for title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections; headings state the bottom line
- **Instructions:** Step‑by‑step where applicable; use present tense and active voice
- **Code:** Examples with proper syntax highlighting
- **Troubleshooting:** Include troubleshooting sections for complex procedures
- **Visuals:** Use diagrams wherever possible; add screenshots and logs tied to each feature
- **Links:** Interlink to related docs; add external links for third‑party tools

## Core Narrative Rules

1. Sell the problem, tell about the solution (focus ~90% on problem, ~10% on solution)
2. Position technology evolution as the driver of new security requirements
3. Emphasize architecture and execution models over features
4. Frame security outcomes as consequences of design choices, not product claims
5. Present solutions as inevitable responses to systemic constraints
6. Maintain credibility through precision, not hype
